        the complement. The two are disjoint, so a complete competitor-by-period

        competitors x periods.

        Start and end dates for every matchup period, derived rather than entered.

        Two inputs, both already available:

        1. A season-level week grid. Week 1 begins on the MONDAY of the week
           containing the regular-season opener (nba.key_dates), and every week
           runs Monday to Sunday. The week containing the All-Star break absorbs
           the one after it, giving a 14-day period.
        2. This league's own `settings.scheduleSettings.matchupPeriods`, which
           maps each matchup period to a list of weeks. That is where per-league
           differences live: in 2025-26 league 95537 groups its playoff rounds as
           [18, 19] and [20, 21] while 24608 plays each week as its own period.
           A period's start is its first week's start, its end its last week's
           end.

        Anchoring week 1 on the Monday rather than on the opener itself is
        deliberate. No single rule fits the openers — 2023-24 and 2024-25 both
        began their week on the Monday BEFORE the opener, while 2025-26 began on
        the opener, a Tuesday — and the Monday form is right for two of the three
        outright. For 2025-26 it moves period 1's start back one day to
        2025-10-20, a date with no NBA games at all, so nothing it contains
        changes.

        Verified against the six hand-entered league-seasons: 2023-24 and 2024-25
        reproduce exactly, and 2025-26's four leagues differ only in that one
        inert day. Three of the six group several weeks into a period, so the
        mapping is exercised, not just the 1:1 case.

        """
        Periods where a competitor has no opponent, taken from ESPN's own
        matchupPeriodId.

        ESPN represents a bye as a schedule entry carrying only one side: a
        `home` with no `away` (or the reverse). That entry's matchupPeriodId is
        the authoritative period, so byes are read straight off the raw league
        payload rather than inferred.

        The previous implementation compared each competitor's `schedule` LENGTH
        against a scaffold of every period and treated the shortfall as a bye.
        That can only ever attribute a bye to the TRAILING period, so a
        mid-season bye was reported at the wrong index — and since
        get_league_matchup pads a None at that index, the error propagated into
        league_matchup. Every 2025-26 row it produced was two periods late:
        league 24608's bye is at 19 and it said 21, 95537's is at 17 and it said
        19, 1382487116's is at 20 and it said 22, 1966813226's is at 18 and it
        said 20. Verified against the one-sided entries for all ten known ESPN
        league-seasons, four of which have no byes at all.

        con.teams[].schedule is not used here: espn_api omits the bye from that
        list in some seasons and inserts None in others, which is what made a
        length comparison look plausible in the first place.
