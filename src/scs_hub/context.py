        Every source id one platform reported for a season — the ids to loop when

        This replaces the old `active_players` frame, which read
        util.conformed_player_id.is_active: a stored boolean that no code in this
        repo ever wrote and that no util.update_schedule row refreshed. It had
        drifted badly — 124 players with a 2025-26 roster row were not flagged,
        29 had no crosswalk row at all, and the nba loops saw 523 ids where the
        season actually held 683.

        util.active_player_vw derives the answer instead, from tables the daily
        jobs already refresh, so it cannot go stale. It is also deliberately
        wider than "active": a source id with no player_key yet still comes back,
        so a player who arrives mid-season is fetched on the first run that sees
        them rather than waiting on identity resolution.

        Cached per (platform, season) because the statyx component alone asks
        eleven times per run, and the view scans the box scores.
