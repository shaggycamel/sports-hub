-- Operating util.player / util.player_source_id. Recipes, not a script to run
-- wholesale. Each block is independent; all have been rehearsed against local
-- Postgres inside a transaction.

-- 1. IS THERE ANYTHING TO DO?
-- The daily jobs that write the source tables are the detector. Non-empty means
-- run hub.util.conform_player_ids().
SELECT platform, count(*) AS unresolved
FROM util.unmatched_player_source_vw
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;

-- 2. INTEGRITY CHECKS — every check must report 0 failures. Worth running after
-- any resolve, apply or manual edit. In Python (hub.util.check_player_identity())
-- for all three; this view (dev/build_player_identity_check.sql) carries the two
-- a portable query can compute.
SELECT * FROM util.player_identity_check WHERE failures > 0;   -- want no rows
-- hub.util.check_player_identity()   # same, plus colliding_names (NFKD fold)

-- 3. WHAT DID THE MATCHER INVENT? Review queue. Most are legitimate — the box
-- scores reach back to 2009-10 and statyx carries college prospects — so this is
-- for spotting splits, not for clearing to zero.

-- 4. FIND SPLITS THE MATCHER CANNOT: pairs differing only by a generational
-- suffix, which the fold deliberately does NOT strip. Read every result
-- before acting — "Jameer Nelson" and "Jameer Nelson Jr." are father and son,
-- and automating this rule would merge them. The fold itself is Python
-- (norm_name() in utility.py); this SQL approximation only needs the trailing
-- suffix, so lower + strip punctuation is enough for a human review.

-- 6. CORRECT A DISPLAY NAME. conformed_name is the only field a human owns; no
-- job overwrites it. Matching happens on norm_name() (Python), so a cosmetic fix here
-- cannot break an existing mapping — but changing it to a DIFFERENT person's
-- normalised name would, so re-run check (2).

-- record and is NOT reconstructible from util.player_directory_vw alone, since

-- GENERATED BY DEFAULT (not ALWAYS) precisely so this works — explicit values
-- are accepted on insert. The sequence does NOT learn about them, though: after
-- restoring keys up to 2737, the next auto-allocated key was still 2738 in
-- testing, so reset it or the next conform_player_ids() collides on the PK.

-- 8b. REBUILD FROM SCRATCH. dev/build_player_identity.sql (DDL), then the views
-- file, then hub.util.conform_player_ids(). Expected afterwards: 2737 players,
-- 5070 mappings, 0 orphans, 0 backlog. The old seed from
-- util."conformed_player_id_RETIRED" has been removed, so a directory-only
-- rebuild is INCOMPLETE — player_directory_vw never reports espn/yahoo ids for
-- players outside the seasons fty holds data for. Restore from a snapshot (8a)
-- instead when you can.

-- 9. ADD A PLATFORM. No DDL — the mapping table is already long. Add a UNION arm
-- to util.player_directory_vw returning (season, platform, source_id,
-- source_name) and resolve. Nothing else changes: ctx.active_ids('<platform>')
-- works immediately, and nothing needs a new column.
